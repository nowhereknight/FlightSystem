# Flight Purchase System

Algorithms and Data Structures Final Project implemented on python which simulates a flight purchasing system. On it you can purchase tickets and determine the best posible route with the least amount of scales.

## Theory Implemented
For this project the implementation of many algorithms seen in the Algorithms and Data Structures Course, such as the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path and the modification to find a list with the paths that could be taken in ascending number depending on the amount of scales. The transformation of a list into a Binary Search Tree to speed up the execution time of the search method, as well as the implementation of the Quick Sort Algorithm. All of these in Python.

### Execution

The system uses two files as a primitive typeof database tables to contain the flights and users information. 

The execution of the program would be as follows
```
python main.py
```

Once inside, there are two types of users. The administrator type and the user type. As administrator you are allowed to: Create users, flights and check flights. 

As administer type there is a default user named Prueba with password Prueba. As user type there is a default user named User with password User.
